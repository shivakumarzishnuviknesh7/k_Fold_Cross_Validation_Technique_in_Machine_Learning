K-fold cross-validation is a resampling technique used to evaluate the performance and generalizability of a machine learning model. It addresses several key issues in the model evaluation process, particularly those related to bias, variance, and the overfitting or underfitting of a model. In this project, the K-fold cross-validation technique is applied to evaluate the model's performance.
